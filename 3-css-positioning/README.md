# 3 CSS | positioning

Pathname: 3-css-positioning

The purpose of the task is to experiment with basic layout tools in css, such as the box model, column layout, multi-columns, margins, padding, the properties display, float, clear, etc. Since bootstrap mainly builds on flex-box, the exercise also includes a part where the ability to practice this tool is included.

## Part one (part two is under the pictures)

1. Clone the excersise and open DevTools for warnings/errors. Correct the errors (meta tags). Ignore if JavaScript errors appears.
2. Add other necessary meta tags like author, description, keywords, etc
3. Create an external css file in a folder named style, and link it in the head element
4. Why is the text "Section 1", placed inside a section smaller than the text "Positioning CSS" in the header since both are placed in a h1? Change so they are equal, when you understand the answer.
5. Position the content according to the wireframe of the task, only use diplay, float and position

## A lof-i wireframe

## Part two

6. Now, make some wireframes for the rest of the webbsites pages. Its ok if they are lo-fi

- **products** should have placeholders, buttons and some info for at least 12-15 products
- **contact** should contain at least one well-suited picture, and a form
- **about** should contain at least informtiion of the company (lorem ipsum is fine), and som photos of at least three staff-memebers

7. Use your CSS-skills to make those webpages layout look like the wireframes you just made.
