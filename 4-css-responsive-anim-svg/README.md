# 4 CSS | responsivness, animations and the use of svg

Pathname: 4-css-responsive-anim-svg

The aim of the exercise is to understand the basics of how to create an responsive website. It is also an opportunity to experiment with different animattion tools in CSS like transform, transistion and animation, and also an opportunity to use svg.

The website should *at least* contain the following self descriptive pages, with relevant content.

- index.html

- products.html *or* gallery.html

- about.html

- contact.html

- blog.html *or* news.html

Make at least two interesting and useful animations, such as modal techniques for images, an animated menu, or similar.

Draw an interesting logo using svg, and insert it in the header of each page, with the use of the element svg, its children and their attributes. <https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp>

Use you rown images, or from site like <https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/>

Text should be relevant to the content, but "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text is sufficient.

Feel free to use from previous exercises created pages as a starting point. Preferably use flexbox as this is also used by Bootstrap, but alternatively grids, grid-views and the like can be used. Reference to responsive templates such as w3.css, or frameworks such as Bootstrap should not be used this time.
