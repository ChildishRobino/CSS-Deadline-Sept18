# 4 CSS | responsivness, animations and the use of svg

Pathname: 4-css-responsive-anim-svg

The aim of the exercise is to understand the basics of how to create an responsive website. It is also an opportunity to experiment with different animattion tools in CSS like transform, transistion and animation, and also an opportunity to use svg.

The website should contain **at least two** of the following pages

- index.html (required)

- products.html

- gallery.html

- about.html

- contact.html

Preferably use flexbox as this is also used by Bootstrap, but alternatively grids, grid-views and the like can be used. Reference to responsive templates such as w3.css, or frameworks such as Bootstrap should not be used this time.



## Additional general instructions

1. This is a group effort, and as such uses github (and Live Share where appropriate).

2. Your repo should include, in addition to all other files
    - a README.md, where the website/project is described
    - a file called logbook.md, a written account of who did what
    - a .gitignore file
