# 6 HTML & CSS | Course submission

Pathname: 6-course-submission

The objective of the submission is to create a small but, according to best practice, adequate website, using techniques taught during the course.

Architecture and content must be built around *at least* the following subpages

- index.html
- products.html (including a gallery)
- about.html
- contact.html
- blog.html or news.html

The website must display a sufficiently professional level for best practice on the Internet, in terms of content, layout and code quality.

## Grade G
All pages of the website must be created using wireframes, which are included in a single folder called wireframes, alternatively inserted in an md file included in the project.

The website must be responsive satisfactory enough, use at least five bootstrap snippets and take some accessibility and search engine optimization into account. The page must show code separation according to best practice, use semantic elements and present a sufficiently good layout.

The code must exhibit code quality and be free of obvious bugs. Tests have been used where appropriate.

## Grade VG
In addition to what applies to the grade G, the following requirements must also be implemented.

The student demonstrates in-depth knowledge and use of elements, selectors, responsiveness, Bootstrap, accessibility and search engine optimization. Animations are also used and in some relevant way. Some use of custom scalable vector graphics is present.

Students may have to prove their knowledge in an oral examination individually if there are any uncertainties about the individual level of knowledge.

## Additional general instructions

1. This is a group effort, and as such uses github (and Live Share where appropriate).

2. The teacher must be invited to your repo

3. Your repo must include, in addition to all other files
    - README.md, where the website/project is described
    - A file called logbook.md, a written account of who did what
    - A .gitignore file

4. Each group must also be prepared to present their work to the rest of the class

> The entire task must be submitted in Omniway, by compressing the root folder (only zip or rar is accepted). Any written tasks and submission questions that belong to the task are answered in Omniway.
