# 5 CSS | Bootstrap

Pathname: 5-css-bootstrap

The purpose with the exercise is by using various snippets, plugins and themes, the student will be able to understand and edit a website's CSS using Bootstrap. The aim is to test most (or all) of bootstrap's possibilities, partly based on Bootsrap's own html code but also based on creating an own HTML skeleton which then uses Bootstrap.

Make at least three pages to your project, for example

- index.html
- products.html
- contact.html

Install Bootstrap, or use the link.

Add one componenet of your own choosing from every (!) Bootstrap example <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/>  (see the right menu) to where they seams to fit nice to those pages. Add more pages if thats feels necessary.

Now try at least the foolowing example to see some of them in context

| Componenet | in context |
| ----------- | ----------- |
